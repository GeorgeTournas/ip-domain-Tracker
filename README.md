## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow to improve skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out an IP Address and Domain Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. IP Address locations, are fetched through [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) and the map is generated using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
